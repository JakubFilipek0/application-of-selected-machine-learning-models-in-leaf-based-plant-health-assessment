# application-of-selected-machine-learning-models-in-leaf-based-plant-health-assessment
This thesis compares the effectiveness of four different neural network architectures in classifying plant health based on leaf images from the PlantVillage dataset, focusing on tomatoes. The architectures studied include AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG16, and Vision Transformer (ViT), evaluated under two main configurations: color and grayscale images. The study also examines the impact of using Adam and SGD optimizers on classification performance. The experimental results reveal significant variations in classification accuracy among the architectures, suggesting opportunities for optimization through different image configurations and optimizers. The findings contribute to a better understanding of selecting suitable neural network architectures for robust plant health recognition systems, with practical implications for agriculture and crop management.
